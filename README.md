of an archival management system product on Amazon Web Services.

These files go in ~/aws/

In the management console, you will need to go to "My Account" >

Certificate".  Download the .pem files and put them in ~/.ec2 .

Create a file .dbpass in ~/.ec2 with the password for the database.

Create a private ssh key at ~/.ec2/ec2-keypair .

Fix the permissions on ~/.ec2 :

```sh
chmod -R 700 ~/.ec2/
chmod -R 600 ~/.ec2/*
```

Grab the amazon command line tools.

```sh
./grabazon.sh
```
