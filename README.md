## Archival applicaiton set up scripts for AWS

This github gist contains scripts used to launch the alpha version
of an archival management system product on Amazon Web Services.

todo
----

needs reorder; see source code of these file for most up to date comments

 * `./launch-build.sh`  lanuch an ec2 to build the app and test it with selenium/firefox; then upload to s3; ping irc
   -  `./upload_files.py`  generate temporary signed s3 upload URLs to POST files
 * `./launch-ec2.sh`  start up an RDS database, then start up an EC2 server
   -  `./as_role_account.sh.template.sh`  template for install script run as `aspace` user 
   -  `./archivesspace.sh`  init.d style start script for jar file

here is the original order / some obsolete parts removed 2013-Mar-06

Installation
------------

The system configuration files in this gist go in `~/aws/`

In the management console, you will need to go to "My Account" >
"Security Credentials" > "X.509 Certificates" > "Create a new
Certificate".  Download the two `.pem` files and put them in `~/.ec2` .

Create a file `.dbpass` in `~/.ec2` with the password for the database.

Create a private ssh key at `~/aws/ec2-keypair` .

(most commands assume current working directory of `~/aws`)

```
. setenv.sh
ec2-create-keypair ec2-keypair
```

Fix the permissions on `~/.ec2` and `~/aws/ec2-keypair` :

```sh
chmod -R 700 ~/.ec2/
chmod -R 700 ~/aws/
chmod -R 600 ~/.ec2/*
chmod -R 600 ~/aws/ec2-keypair
```

Grab the amazon command line tools.

```sh
./grabazon.sh
```

Also; https://github.com/aws/aws-cli is needed

The python library `boto` needs to be set up with the S3 credential for the push to S3 to work.

grant access (security groups left as an exercise for the reader)

```
ec2-authorize blah -p 22
ec2-authorize blah -p 80
rds-authorize-db-security-group-ingress blah --ec2-security-group-name blah --ec2-security-group-owner-id 8675309
```

Set up RDS parameter group for utf8

```sh
rds-create-db-parameter-group --db-parameter-group-family mysql5.5 --description "utf8" --db-parameter-group-name utf8

rds-modify-db-parameter-group utf8 \
>     --parameters="name=character_set_server, value=utf8, method=immediate" \
>     --parameters="name=character_set_client, value=utf8, method=immediate" \
>     --parameters="name=character_set_results, value=utf8, method=immediate" \
>     --parameters="name=collation_server, value=utf8_unicode_ci, method=immediate" \
>     --parameters="name=collation_connection, value=utf8_unicode_ci, method=immediate"

```

## Every new release

Build the .jar and .war files
-----------------------------

Launch a m1.large, build the `.jar` and `.war`, push the artifacts to S3, terminate instance.

```sh
./launch-build.sh
```
(ubuntu/alestic.com)

Launch the EC2 server.
----------------------

Start up the database, wait, start up an ec2, wait, report hostname (sould report instance id as well probably)

```sh
./launch-ec2.sh
```
(amazon linux)

AWS Command Documentation
------------------

[aws-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) is new

[ec2-run-instances](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-RunInstances.html) is old and used by `launch-build.sh`

[ubuntu cloud init](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit) is used by the [Amazon Linux AMI](http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/)
