## Archival applicaiton set up scripts for AWS

This github gist contains scripts used to launch the alpha version
of an archival management system product on Amazon Web Services.


Installation
------------
The system configuration files in this gist go in `~/aws/`

In the management console, you will need to go to "My Account" >
"Security Credentials" > "X.509 Certificates" > "Create a new
Certificate".  Download the two `.pem` files and put them in `~/.ec2` .

Create a file `.dbpass` in `~/.ec2` with the password for the database.

Create a private ssh key at `~/aws/ec2-keypair` .

(most commands assume current working directory of `~/aws`)

```
. setenv.sh
ec2-create-keypair ec2-keypair
```

Fix the permissions on `~/.ec2` and `~/aws/ec2-keypair` :

```sh
chmod -R 700 ~/.ec2/
chmod -R 700 ~/aws/
chmod -R 600 ~/.ec2/*
chmod -R 600 ~/aws/ec2-keypair
```

Grab the amazon command line tools.

```sh
./grabazon.sh
```

Launch services on AWS
----------------------

Launch an AWS RDS server.

```sh
./launch-rds.sh
```

Wait for the server to spin up.  At first, `rds-describe-db-instances` will return something like this:
```
DBINSTANCE  alpha01  db.m1.small  mysql  10  aspace  creating  us-east-1b  1  ****  n  5.5.25a  general-public-license
      SECGROUP  default  active
      PARAMGRP  default.mysql5.5  in-sync
      OPTIONGROUP  default:mysql-5-5  in-sync
```

Once the database has cranked up; you should see something like this:

```
DBINSTANCE  alpha01  2012-08-31T20:27:02.502Z  db.m1.small  mysql  10  aspace  backing-up  alpha01.blahblah.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com  3306  us-east-1b  1  n  5.5.25a  general-public-license
      SECGROUP  default  active
      PARAMGRP  default.mysql5.5  in-sync
      OPTIONGROUP  default:mysql-5-5  in-sync
```

grant access (security groups left as an exercise for the reader)

```
ec2-authorize blah -p 22
ec2-authorize blah -p 80
rds-authorize-db-security-group-ingress blah --ec2-security-group-name blah --ec2-security-group-owner-id 8675309

```

Launch the EC2 server.

```sh
./launch-ec2.sh
```
